# üé£ Phishing Attack Simulation (Ethical Use Only)

This project simulates a phishing attack by creating a fake login page (e.g., Facebook clone). When a user inputs credentials, they are captured and saved for analysis in a local file.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

- Local web server (XAMPP, WAMP, MAMP)
- PHP support
- HTML/CSS (optional for styling)

---

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Copy the `fake_login/` folder into your web server's root directory:
   - XAMPP: `htdocs/`
   - WAMP: `www/`

2. Start Apache server.

3. Visit:  
   `http://localhost/fake_login/`

---

## üß™ How It Works

- The `index.html` file mimics a login page.
- When the form is submitted, data is POSTed to `login.php`.
- The `login.php` script saves the credentials in `credentials.txt`.

---

## üïµÔ∏è Simulation Use Cases

- Demonstrate how easy phishing can be.
- Train users on phishing awareness.
- Conduct security awareness sessions.

---

## üîê Prevention Tips

- Always verify URLs before logging in.
- Use browser-based password managers.
- Enable 2FA on all accounts.
- Educate users regularly.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Ethical Reminder

> This is a controlled simulation for educational use only. Never conduct phishing without written permission.

---
## üîê Next Steps (Advanced)

* Host on LAN or internal virtual machine for simulation.
* Customize for other sites (Gmail, Instagram, etc.).
* Add logging for IP and timestamp.
* Use **ngrok** to tunnel for mobile/lab access (ethical use only).
